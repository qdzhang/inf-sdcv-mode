* inf-sdcv-mode

Inferior sdcv mode to search words.

[[inf-sdcv-mode.png]]

There is already a sdcv-mode written by the original author:
https://github.com/pluskid/sdcv-mode
But I only need a few functions, so I write this simpler version.

** Installation
Download the repository, then

#+begin_src elisp
(load "/path/to/inf-sdcv-mode.el")
(require 'inf-sdcv-mode)
#+end_src

** Usage
Bind the main function =inf-sdcv-search= to your favorite key. For example, I
use =C-c d= (this keybindings is not default).

** Keybindings
The keybings of  =inf-sdcv-mode-map= is:

| keybindings | description                                               |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
| =j=         | jump to the specific dictionary                           |
| =r=         | search history backward                                   |
| =l=         | search history forward                                    |
| =h=         | hide all dicts contents, only show the name of dictionary |
| =a=         | show all contents                                         |
| =e=         | show current dictionary contents                          |
| =c=         | hide current dictionary contents                          |
| =N=         | next dictionary                                           |
| =P=         | previous dictionary                                       |
